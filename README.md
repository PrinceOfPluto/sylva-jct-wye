# Railroader - Sylva Junction Wye

This adds a new wye junction in Sylva that connects with the Atlantic Railway's Class 1 mainline. This is very useful for turning around passenger trains after the last stop at Sylva Depot. The wye can accommodate even larger locomotives like the B-65 Berkshire.

In Company mod, the wye can be built in a two phase milestone named Sylva Junction Wye. Each phase costs $2,000 and involves 9 cars. In Sandbox, you can enable it within Map Features.

All mods are installable through [Railloader](https://railroader.stelltis.ch/)
