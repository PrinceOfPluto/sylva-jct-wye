# Railroader - Sylva Junction Wye

This adds a new wye junction in Sylva that connects with the Atlantic Railway's Class 1 mainline. This is very useful for turning around passenger trains after the last stop at Sylva Depot. The wye can accommodate even larger locomotives like the B-65 Berkshire.

All mods are installable through [Railloader](https://railroader.stelltis.ch/)

## Installation

### Requirements:
- [Railloader](https://railroader.stelltis.ch/) 1.7.2
- [Strange Customs](https://railroader.stelltis.ch/mods/strange-customs) 1.6+ (Beta Version)
- [Alina's Map Mods](https://railroader.alinanova.dev/) 1.3+

### Steps:

2. Drop onto Railloader.exe
3. Done!

### Troubleshooting

If it doesn't work, check in Preferences => Features => Mod Settings
Pluto's Sylva Junction Wye should show loaded, if not an error will show. If it says Strange Customs did not load, and you use UMM, goto Railloader at the top and click the big magic button.
